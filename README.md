# How to run
1. Fork/Clone/Download this folder
2. Install NodeJs and MongoDB (Just google it, its different for each OS)
3. Navigate to your newly downloaded folder in your favorite terminal and run  `node app.js` for a one time run
4. When developing I like to use nodemon (already included in node_modules) this auto restarts the server everytime a .js file is changed. Start this with  `nodemon`
5. In any web browser of your choice navigate to `localhost:7000`
6. Voilla

## Side Notes
This is based off a starter template me and a friend made to get JS web servers up and running in no time, theres a lot of user account and profile stuff in there that I just haven't gotten rid of yet. 

Any questions feel free to hit me up on slack @Eric Udlis
